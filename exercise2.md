Now we will implement row-level security (RLS) and role-based access control (RBAC). The goal is to define several types of roles for different user groups.

ROLES

- superadmin_role
- admin_role
- regular_role
- Note: anonymous users cannot access any tables (select, insert, update, delete are all forbidden)

POLICIES

- TBD
